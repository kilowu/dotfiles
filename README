Emacs init.el
-------------

- Requires

  Emacs version >= 25.1


- Installation

  1. git clone this repo
  2. (M-X package-refresh-contents RET)
  3. Add the following one-liner in .emacs or .emacs.d/init.el

      (load "~/path/to/your/git-repo/.emacs.d/init.el")

- Other Notes

  The irony mode (brings C/C++ IDE to emacs) requires a C++ server program
  "irony-server" running under the background, which in turn requires CMake
  and libclang to build.
